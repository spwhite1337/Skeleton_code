# Instructional Code

The original intention of this project was to consolidate and back-up a lot of useful notebooks / modules I have come across to perform various engineering / analytics tasks. 

Many of them are obsolete now that I have more experience, but the notebook serve as a useful aid for people new to data science. 

A big improvement would result if I incorporated walkthroughs on environment set-up (Python, R on both windows, linux).
